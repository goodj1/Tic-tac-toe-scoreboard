I made this scoreboard using Javascript.

I used only HTML, CSS and Javascript to complete this scoreboard.

There scoreboard is for only two players. There is also a reset button 
which reset the scores back to "0" if both participants decide to restart
their game.

Also participants can set a limit to how many games they want to play. For
example, if myself and my oponent set the game limit to 5 this means will
mean that the first person to reach the number 5 is the winner, as a result, 
there is Game Over and none of the candidates can change the scores.

Furthermore, both candidates will know the winner when their score changes to
the color green.
